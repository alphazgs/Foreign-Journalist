At least 16 EU countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain,
suspended the use of AstraZeneca’s covid-19 vaccine, following reports that
a handful of people had developed blood-clots after receiving it. Several
regulators, including the World Health Organisation, said that the risks of
not getting jabbed far outweighed those of getting jabbed. Experts predicted
that the delay would cost lives and needlessly undermine confidence in both
the AstraZeneca vaccine and vaccines more generally.
Germany’s ruling Christian Democrats performed badly in two important
state elections, Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate. The results
are a blow to the party’s new leader, Armin Laschet, and a sign that
Germans are unimpressed by the government’s handling of the covid crisis.
A general election in the Netherlands appears to have given Mark Rutte, the
centre-right prime minister, a chance to form a new government, though
assembling a coalition will be complicated. D66, a pro-European liberal
party, did surprisingly well, as did the populist right.
Britain published a review of defence and foreign policy. One surprise was a
reversal of the decision taken a decade ago to reduce the nuclear stockpile 
from 225 to 180 warheads by the mid-2020s. Britain will now increase its
arsenal to 260 by the middle of the decade, the first escalation since the peak
of the cold war, when Britain had over 500. Official figures about
operational stockpiles and deployed warheads will no longer be published.
Police in Bolivia arrested Jeanine Áñez, the president of a recent interim
government, and other officials, accusing them of plotting a coup against
Evo Morales. Mr Morales resigned as president in November 2019 amid
accusations of fraud in his re-election. The charges against Ms Áñez are
probably a retribution for the similar charges her government filed against
officials from Mr Morales's party.
John Magufuli, the president of Tanzania, died at the age of 61, after weeks
of speculation that he was being treated for covid-19. Mr Magufuli had
ordered his government not to vaccinate people against the virus, nor to take
steps to limit its spread, insisting that God had cleansed the country of it.
Gunmen on motorcycles killed at least 58 people in northern Niger, near the
border with Mali. Jihadists have been active in the region.
Regional forces from Ethiopia’s Amhara state took control of parts of
Tigray, which is next door. The occupation could add fuel to a civil war
between the federal government and Tigray’s ousted rulers. It may also
increase tensions around other disputed internal borders in the country,
which is a federation of ten ethnically based states.
Police in Uganda again arrested a popular opposition leader known by his
stage name, Bobi Wine. Hundreds of people have been detained since a
disputed presidential election earlier this year that was won by Yoweri
Museveni, who has ruled since 1986.
A new interim government in Libya was sworn in, replacing two rival
administrations. Its main task is to prepare the war-torn country for elections
in December. Libya descended into conflict after the last nationwide
elections, in 2014.
A court in Japanfound that the government was wrong to ban same-sex
marriages. But it stopped short of overturning the policy, saying instead that
parliament should be given time to legislate on the matter.
The military junta that has seized power in Myanmar declared martial law in
the country's two biggest cities, in an effort to curb protests. Soldiers have
shot dead more than 200 people. China, meanwhile, urged Myanmar to
protect Chinese-owned factories after several were set on fire during unrest
in Yangon. Anti-government protesters accuse China of supporting the
military takeover, which China denies.
A gunman killed eight people at three massage parlours in Atlanta. Six of
the dead were Asian-American women. Pundits speculated that the shooter
might have had a racial motive, but he told police he was a sex addict and
wanted to remove a source of temptation. Police said it was too early to
draw any conclusions about the crime.
In Texas eight unauthorised immigrants were killed when their car crashed
during a police chase. Migrants are once again heading in large numbers to
the US-Mexican border and trying to enter America. Republicans blame Joe
Biden’s relaxation of Donald Trump’s strict immigration rules.
More Democrats, including Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Senate, called
on Andrew Cuomo to resign as governor of New York amid allegations of
sexual harassment. Mr Cuomo said he would not bow to “cancel culture”.
Team New Zealand won the 36th America’s Cup. The oldest trophy in
international sport featured high-tech sailing boats racing at up 50 knots
(over 90kph). New Zealand’s deft handling of the pandemic allowed the
contest to go ahead, but only a few teams took part, thanks to covid-19.
